**Shobdo Kolpo Droom**
> Bangla handwriting recognition using rcnn based PHOCNet algorithm.



### Literature Review
  
  - PHOCNet: A Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Word Spotting in Handwritten Documents, Sebastian Sudholt et. al.  https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00187
  - HMM-based Indic Handwritten Word Recognition
using Zone Segmentation, Partha Pratim Roy et. al.  http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.patcog.2016.04.012
  - A Statistical approach to line segmentation in handwritten
documents, Manivannan Arivazhagan et. al.  https://doi.org/10.1117/12.704538



### Data Collection
  - [x] Collect handwritten documents
      - Collected over 9000 pages of bangla hand written pages
      - Confirmed 150 writer
  - [x] Digitize hand written documents
